    content:
    - What is this and why do I care?
    - Git is a distributed collaboration tool
    - A git workflow is how software developers use git to collaborate in a productive way
    - Merging and deploying of code shouldn't be a job in and of itself
    notes: Why did the chicken cross the road?
  - name: Some examples
    type: list
    content:
    - gitflow -- very robust great for versioned scheduled releases
    - github flow -- simplier great for continuous deployment
    notes: gitflow is complex and can be confusing and code gets lost.

  - name: gitflow - pros
    type: list
    content:
      - supports forks and pull requests
      - clear what the current "version" is
      - tracking what changes are in each "version" is easy
      - seems to fit well into good agile practices
      - there is always an active development branch and a passive master branch
  - name: gitflow - cons
    type: list
    content:
      - there is always an active development branch and a passive master branch
      - loosely dependent on the idea that each sprint is marching towards a new "version"
      - tightly coulpled to the idea of releases with multiple features

  - name: github flow - pros
    type: list
    content:
      - simple, one main branch that represents the project
      - features are done on branches and can be independently developed and tested
      - supports forks and pull request
      - tracking what changes are in each feature is easy
  - name: github flow - cons
    type: list
    content:
      - easy for parallel features to diverge from the base and become a nightmare for merging
      - practically perfect in everyway

  - name: SPS CodeFlow - Overview
    type: list
    content:
    - Essentially github flow, but with some added guidelines
    - developers should fork the projects and do all work on their forks
    - main project should only have master branch
    - pull requests are built and can be deployed to test environments
    - master branch commits are tagged with build id
    - code that is deployed will be tagged in master of deployment date
  - name: SPS CodeFlow - Pull requests
    type: list
    content:
    - All code changes need to go through a pull request
    - Everyone reviews the code
    - Everyone is equal and all ideas and concerns shared
    - Discussions need to be constructive
    - Sign-off from key team members required for merge (teams should decide what that means for their team)
  - name: SPS CodeFlow - Versioning
    type: list
    content:
    - YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS[-pull-<PR#>][-<branch>] (utc time)
    - Major version is the current utc date stamp
    - Minor version is the current hour, minute and seconds
    - If the build is of a branch then the branch is appendended
    - If the build is of a Pull Request, then pull-# is appending along with the branch
  - name: Build artifacts
    type: list
    content:
    - Build artifacts should be built and submitted to an Ops approved artifact repository, such as Gemfury
    - Dependent artifacts should be referenced by the exact build number
